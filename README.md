## Project Description

A weather forecasting application using REACT to display a 5-day weather forecast, where each day shows the high and low temperatures, and an image for sunny/rainy/cloudy/snowy. It provide an ability to click on a day and see its hourly forecast.
I have added a React Router to the project with routes, such that / shows the 5-day forecast, and /[name-of-day] shows the hourly forecast for a particular day.The project uses https://openweathermap.org/ to fetch a real 5-day forecast to feed the data into app.
